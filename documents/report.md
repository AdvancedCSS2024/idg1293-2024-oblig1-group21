Process:

1. ANALYSIS
The first thing we did was to analyse the "finn.no" website from the screenshots where we found
different elements and where to put them. We also looked at the typography and planned ahead on what to do.
In screenshot 1 we decided to make the site start with a navigator, then 2 sections (for searchbar and list, and cards).
In screenshot 2 we decided to make the site have 2 boxes. 1 for background (image, paragraph, link) on the left and 
1 for "logg inn" (logo, header, input, link, checkbox with label, button, link) on the right. 
We also looked at the live "finn.no" site to see what they had and compared it with our plan.

2. GITHUB & BEM/SASS
Git was a little hard for us cause we learned a little on how git works on theory, but not in practice.
F.eks we knew what pull request and merge was but never learned properly how. So collaboration was hard to do at the start
when we had merge conflict cause we did not know what to do. We were able to do BEM pretty decent, but SASS was also confusing at
times. Do think we got the basic understanding of it though.

3. DEMO
On the demo we basically put our blocks, elements and classes (and whats needed in them) so that we got the structure to style them
on our SASS later. 

4. STYLING
Then we tried to style our site to look like "finn.no" with BEM and the use of SASS.

5. FINAL
There are some small changes from our original plan to our execution. Since we have looked on the live "finn.no" site there are some
elements we have changed like f.eks "paragraph". In the code we changed it to either h1, h2 or h3 like the one in "finn.no".
Other than that we think we have proven an understanding of BEM. We have not gotten a good understanding of @use for colors used in the SASS and therefore decided not to use it this time, but have gotten a good understanding of design system. We have demonstrated that we can work in a collaborative way using github now. And lastly we have shown we can deploy a simple website in Github pages.
